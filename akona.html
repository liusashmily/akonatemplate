                        <p>The Akona come from a small moon of Wroft-Gar. They look like crystals, but they are alive and very intelligent. The center part is blue, but they are white on the edges. When they are young, they are less than an inch wide, but they can grow to be almost two feet. Their whole body is made to store information. When they learn, they grow another piece of their body to store the information there. The Akona do not move. If they want to go to a new place, they break off pieces of themselves. These pieces grow into new Akona. In this way they spread and can pass information about the new place to the other Akona. But they cannot break off pieces too much or they die. This also means they cannot live on world that has the earthquakes.</p>

                        <h3>Communication</h3>
                        <p>To speak, the Akona make very small vibrations in the blue part of their bodies. These vibrations go through the ground and through each other and other Akona feel them and understand. Sometimes the Akona all vibrate together and it sounds like music. The other species cannot understand the Akona, but the Akona can communicate with the computers the Eolani build. The Eonali did not know the Akona were intelligent until they brought the Akona aboard a ship to study them. After a while, the Akona learned how to talk to the computer. The Eolani were very surprised.</p>

                        <p>The Akona lived on Akonid, a very cold moon of Wroft-Gar. They do not build. They lived on the surface, on the ice and the rock. The surface must be hard. They like to live in the areas that have mountains. From there they could see many stars and galaxies very clearly, and they have gathered information on them for much time. There as no atmosphere where they lived. The Eolani and the Kaylid moved some of the Akona to other worlds in our solar system. They died when it got too warm at more than 100K. Another thing that makes them die is water, even when it is ice or when it is so hot it is a gas.</p>

                        <p>The Akona do not make any tools of their own, but they know how to work with the computers of the Eolani. The Akona hold much knowledge in their bodies, and this they can share with the computers. Someone asks the computer to do something, the computer tells the Akona what information it needs, and the Akona gives it. Now the Akona travel on all the space missions of the Eolani and the Kaylid and work with their computers. The Akona like this very much because they can learn so many new things.</p>
